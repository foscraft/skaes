            As a consequence of the fact that the most famous poems tend to be the older ones,
             they also often have distinct rhyme schemes threaded throughout the verses. 
             While I personally do think rhyming poems are generally better, 
             and that partially also accounts for their fame, I recognise how subjective this adjective is.
              Moreover, non-rhyming poems have played a significant role in literature during the 
              last century in particular. In fact, the influence of poems such as Ginsberg
              (#5 below) on his adherents would probably be difficult to overestimate. 
              Instead of confining myself to the older, rhyming poems which usually make up lists like this,
               Iâ€™ve therefore picked and chosen to ensure a fuller range of poets. 
               This reflects a more diverse canon.
